= Storage Management

Red Hat OpenShift supports multiple types of storage, both for on-premises and cloud providers. OpenShift Virtualization can use any supported container storage interface (CSI) provisioner in the environment you're running on. For example, OpenShift Data Foundation, NetApp, Dell/EMC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Pure Storage, Portworx, and many others support on-premises, CSI provisioned, ReadWriteMany (RWX) volumes with OpenShift Virtualization.

This workshop segment will explore Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), which are used to request storage from the provider and store a VM disk. Many storage providers also support snapshots and clones of their devices, be sure to check with your vendor to verify the features supported by the CSI driver and storage device.

Notably, there are no restrictions on storage protocol (e.g. NFS, iSCSI, FC, etc.) specific to OpenShift Virtualization. The only requirement is that the RWX access mode is available to support live migration of VMs within the cluster. Otherwise, the storage that best meets the needs of your VMs and applications is always the right choice.

== Examine the PVC for a VM

In this lab, we are going to take a closer look at the storage behind our the virtual machine we just created `fedora01`. 

. Start by clicking on the left menu for `Storage` -> `Persistent Volume Claims`. Make sure you are in the `vmexamples` namespace, you should see the `fedora01` VM from the previous section listed.
+
//add image
+
. Click on the `fedora01` VM and you will be presented with a screen that shows additional details about the storage volume backing the VM. 
+
. Notice the following information about the persistent volume claim:
.. The PVC is currently bound successfuly
.. The PVC has a requested capacity and size of 30GiB
.. The Access mode of the PVC is ReadWriteMany (RWX)
.. The Volume mode of the PVC is Block
.. The volume is using the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization` storage class.

[[managing_snapshots]]
== Managing Snapshots

OpenShift Virtualization relies on the CSI storage provider's snapshot capability to create disk snapshots for the virtual machine, which can be taken "online" while the VM is running or "offline" while the VM is powered off. If the KVM integrations are installed to the VM, you will also have the option of quiescing the guest operating system (quiescing ensures that the snapshot of the disk represents a consistent state of the guest file systems, e.g., buffers are flushed and the journal is consistent).

Since disk snapshots are dependent on the storage implementation, abstracted by CSI, performance impact and capacity used will depend on the storage provider. Work with your storage vendor to determine how the system will manage PVC snapshots and the impact they may or may not have.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Snapshots, by themselves, are not a backup or disaster recovery capability. The data needs to be protected in other ways, such as one or more copies stored in a different location, to recover from the storage system failing.

In addition to the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP), partners such as Kasten by Veeam, Trilio, and Storware support the ability to backup and restore virtual machines to the same cluster or other clusters as needed.
====

With the VM snapshots feature, cluster administrators and application developers can:

* Create a new snapshot
* List all snapshots attached to a specific VM
* Revert a VM to a snapshot
* Delete an existing VM snapshot

=== Creating and Using Snapshots

. Navigate back to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* and select the virtual machine, `fedora01` in the project `vmexamples`.
+
image::module-02/03_VM_Overview.png[]
+
. Notice there are currently no snapshots of this VM listed on the overview page. 
+
image::module-02/04_Snapshots_Overview.png[]
+

// PICK UP HERE ON EDITS -- AC

. Navigate to the *Snapshots* tab.
+
image::module-02/05_Snapshots_Overview.png[]

. Press *Take snapshot* and a dialog will open
+
[NOTE]
There is a warning about the `cloudinitdisk` not being included in the snapshot. This is expected and happens because it is an ephemeral disk.
+
image::module-02/11_VM_Snapshot_Dialog.png[]

. Press *Save* and wait till the _Snapshot_ has been created and the *status* shows as `Succeeded`
+
image::module-02/12_VM_Snapshot_Taken.png[]

. Press the three dots and check that the *Restore* option is greyed out because the VM is running
+
image::module-02/13_VM_Restore_Disabled.png[]

. Switch to the *Console* tab to perform a modification to your running VM. This small modification will break your VM, and it won't be able to boot anymore.
+
Log in with the user `fedora` and password `ocpVirtIsGre@t` (or whatever you used in the previous module). Execute the command:
+
[source,sh]
----
[fedora@fedora02 ~]$ sudo rm -rf /boot/grub2; sudo shutdown -r now
----

. The _Virtual Machine_ will not be able to boot. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
In the previous step, the operating system was shutdown from within the guest. However, OpenShift Virtualization will restart it automatically by default. This behavior can be changed globally or on a per-VM basis.
+
image::module-02/14_VM_Crashed.png[]

. Using the *Actions* dropdown menu, stop the _Virtual Machine_. Wait until the VM is stopped.

. Navigate back to the *Snapshots* tab and press *Restore* on the previously created snapshot.
+
image::module-02/15_VM_Restore.png[]

. In the dialog shown, press *Restore*
+
image::module-02/16_VM_Restore_Dialog.png[]

. Wait until the VM is restored, and then start the VM 
+
image::module-02/17_VM_Restored.png[]

. Verify that the VM is booting correctly again.
+

[[clone_vm]]
== Clone a Virtual Machine

Cloning creates a new VM that uses its disk image for storage, but most of the clone's configuration and stored data is identical to the source VM.

. Press *Clone* from the *Actions* menu, and a dialog will open
+
image::module-02/19_VM_Clone_Dialog.png[]
+
[NOTE]
Notice the VM, if is powered on, it will be stopped to perform the clone. If you have a snapshot of the VM, you can also create a clone from the snapshot without powering off the VM.

. A new VM is created, the disks are cloned and automatically the portal will redirect you to the new VM.
+
image::module-02/20_VM_Cloned.png[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
The cloned VM will have the same identity as the source VM, which may cause conflicts with applications and other clients interacting with the VM. Use caution when cloning a VM connected to an external network or in the same project.

== Summary

In this section of our lab we explored the storage options that are available to us when managing virtual machines. We also performed several VM management functions that are dependant on the storage provisioned for the virtual machine, including taking snapshots of VMs and cloning VMs to be used in another project or to help streamline development.
